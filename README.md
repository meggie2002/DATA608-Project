#  SpeciesWatch: Monitoring Biodiversity with Data & Visualization

SpeciesWatch is a modular data pipeline and dashboard application that enables users to fetch, clean, store, and visualize species-related data. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Docker, it supports scalable deployment and interactive exploration of biodiversity trends.

##  Project Overview

This repository is organized into three main components:

1. **Image Fetching (`api-job`)**  
   - Jupyter notebooks for retrieving species images from external APIs.

2. **Data Cleaning (`eda-job`)**  
   - Python scripts for preprocessing and cleaning raw species data.

3. **Dashboard & Loader (`specieswatch`)**  
   - Streamlit dashboard for data visualization.
   - Data loader for pushing cleaned data into a database.
   - Dockerized architecture for seamless deployment.

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+ (for local development)
